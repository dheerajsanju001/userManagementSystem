The project is named User Management System. Here is the detailed explanation in English with key points:

1. Home Page:

The initial display is the home page.
The top navigation bar contains options for Home, Register, and Login.

2. Registration:

Clicking on the Register option allows users to create a new account.

3. Login:

Clicking on the Login option enables authenticated users to log in using their email and password.

4. Post-Login Page:

After successful login, users are redirected to a page with a welcome message like "Welcome, you are logged in here."
The navigation bar is updated, hiding the Register and Login options.

5. Navigation Bar Options:

Only three options remain in the navigation bar: Home, User, and Logout.

6. Home Option:

Users can click on the Home option to return to the home page.

7. User Listing:

The User option reveals a page displaying a list of all users.
Users have the ability to edit user information from this page.

8. User Details:

Clicking on a user's name in the sidebar opens a page with details about that specific user.
Information includes the active status of the user.

9. Logout:

The user details page features a logout button.
Logout Action:

Clicking on the logout button redirects users to the login page.

10. Access to User Listing:

Importantly, the User option is only visible in the navigation bar when users are logged in.
Access to the user listing is contingent upon user authentication.

This design ensures a structured flow from registration to login, providing users with a seamless experience in managing their accounts and interacting with the application's features.
